Changelog
=========

1.8 (unreleased)
----------------

- Support calling an extra script after asking to upload to PyPI.
  The script will be called with the tag checkout as working dir,
  and it will get ``dist/*`` as argument.  We get the script from
  the environment variable ``AFTER_UPLOAD_SCRIPT``.  You can avoid
  calling this by not doing the tag checkout, or by having a
  ``setup.cfg`` with ``[zest.releaser] release = no``.
  Or simply answer 'No' when we ask if you want to run the command.
